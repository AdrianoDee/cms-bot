# IB Pages

The IB pages are generated by [summary-of-merged-prs](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/summary-of-merged-prs/) which runs [report-summary-merged-prs](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/report-summary-merged-prs).

You can se a diagram of how they are generated [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tvdLXaCqOxpksh28AfjtfPspbVS7Won2d2i19oU1tbE/pub?w=1211&h=726).

The jenkins job generates and deploys the json files generated by [report-summary-merged-prs](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/report-summary-merged-prs), these files
contain the data that is shown in the pages. The json files are deployed [here](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/html/data)

The pages show the IBs for the release queues that are not set as disabled in [config.map](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/config.map).

The script uses information from the following sources: 

  - AFS logs.
  - Official [cmssw repository](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw).
  - Official [cmsdist repository](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist).
  - Elasticsearch, see [Kibana](http://cmskibana.cern.ch/kibana/#/dashboard/file/default.json):
    - The script that generates the pages ([summary-of-merged-prs](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/summary-of-merged-prs/)) 
      does not query directly Elasticsearch. I looks into partial results obtained from [update-github-pages](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/update-github-pages/) 
      which runs [process-logs](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-sw.github.io/blob/master/process-logs)
      and stores them as json files in [cms-sw.github.io](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-sw.github.io).

### There is a github mirror of the pages

  - The pages in cmssdt can be found in [https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/html/showIB.html](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/html/showIB.html)
  - You can also see the a github mirror in [http://cms-sw.github.io/showIB.html](http://cms-sw.github.io/showIB.html)

## Html and javascript files for the IB pages.

[showIB.html](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/templates/showIB.html) is the main file of the pages. It uses javascript code found [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/tree/master/templates/js)

## Test Details Pages

The details for the relvals results can be seen by using [relvalLogDetail.html](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-sw.github.io/blob/master/relvalLogDetail.html),
you can use the following syntax:

https://cms-sw.github.io/relvalLogDetail.html#\<architecture\>;\<IB\>

For example: [https://cms-sw.github.io/relvalLogDetail.html#slc6_amd64_gcc491;CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-05-09-1100](https://cms-sw.github.io/relvalLogDetail.html#slc6_amd64_gcc491;CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-05-09-1100)

Will show you the results for CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-05-09-1100 for arch slc6_amd64_gcc491. 

The results are in 
[https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-sw.github.io/tree/master/data/relvals/slc6_amd64_gcc491](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-sw.github.io/tree/master/data/relvals/slc6_amd64_gcc491)

These pages use [RelvalsAvailableResults.json](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-sw.github.io/blob/master/data/RelvalsAvailableResults.json)
to know for which IBs are results available for the Relvals. 

These links are automatically generated from the main IB pages.

For the compilation, unit tests, and addon tests results, it is still used the old version. 

### Incomplete detail pages for incomplete results. 

When the results are incomplete, [relvalLogDetail.html](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-sw.github.io/blob/master/relvalLogDetail.html) will look for the "_INCOMPLETE.json" file
in [https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-sw.github.io/tree/master/data/relvals](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-sw.github.io/tree/master/data/relvals)
and it inform accordingly.

## The IB Pages can report incomplete results from Elasticsearch

[update-github-pages](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/update-github-pages/) runs periodicaly to parse the results 
from AFS logs and ES about the IBs (Compilation, Unit tests, Relvals). 
It saves the results in json files [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-sw.github.io/tree/master/data). When a result is found in ES but not in AFS,
the name of the json file will end with the suffix "_INCOMPLETE.json". [summary-of-merged-prs](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/summary-of-merged-prs/) 
uses these json files to identify results that are currently not complete and show them in the pages. An incomplete result can indicate for compilation results, 
that the IB being is built, and for the Unit tests and Relvals indicates that the validation for that IB is being run.

If the validation job for the IB fails, the paratial results still can be shown in the IB pages if ES is available.
