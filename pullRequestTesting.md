# Pull Request Testing

cms-bot can run the following tests on a pull request:

  - Compilation
  - Unit Tests
  - Relvals
  - Static analyser checks
  - DQM Tests
  - Clang Compilation

## Main Scripts

  - [run-pr-tests](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/run-pr-tests) is the script that runs the tests on the pull requests.
    It is run by [ib-any-integration](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/ib-any-integration) in jenkins.
  - [report-pull-request-results](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/report-pull-request-results) is the script that is used
    by [run-pr-tests](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/run-pr-tests) to report the results of the tests.

## Automatic triggering

  - [get-pr-branch](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/get-pr-branch): script that prints the branch to which a pull request
    was created.
  - [pr-schedule-tests](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/pr-schedule-tests): script that sets the parameters to trigger
    [ib-any-integration](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/ib-any-integration) depending on [get-pr-branch](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/get-pr-branch) 
    and [config.map](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/config.map). It is run by [ib-schedule-pr-tests](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/ib-schedule-pr-tests).

### The pull latest pull requests are checked periodically to check if the tests can be triggered
  - This is handled by [queue-new-prs (jenkins)](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/queue-new-prs/), which runs [queue-new-prs](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/queue-new-prs). It uses
    [query-new-pull-requests](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/query-new-pull-requests) to query the latest pull requests, it then uses the result of 
    [auto-trigger-pr](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/auto-trigger-pr) to decide if the tests for the pull request can be triggered automatically.
    The tests for a pull request are automatically triggered if the following conditions are met:
      - There is at least 1 signature.
      - The tests are pending.
      - It is not already being tested (it checks if the latest commit is marked as "testing").

### The tests can be triggered by L2 or release managers by writing "please test"

  - If a L2 or a release manager writes "please test" in the pull request conversation, the tests are triggered. This is handled by [process-pull-request](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/process-pull-request),
    which generates a file that triggers [ib-schedule-pr-tests](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/ib-schedule-pr-tests/) to get the parameters needed by the tests and start them. 

## Manual Triggering

  - If you want to select only the pull request number and get all the other parameters automatically you can just use [ib-schedule-pr-tests](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/ib-schedule-pr-tests).
    You can write a list of pull request numbers separated by commas. 
  - If you want to set manually all the parameters you can run the tests directly with [ib-any-integration](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/ib-any-integration).
